# Tech Blog

## Description
A CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts.

## Usage

To use this application, navigate to the deployed website link below. On the home page, the user will see any existing posts. Before the user can interact with any existing posts, they will need to click on the "Login" button in the navigation area at the top of the page. If they have already created an account, they can enter their credentials and login to the site. If they do not have an account, they can click the "Sign Up" button below the login form and create an account. If the user clicks on the dashboard link while not logged in, they will be sent to the login page to either login or sign up. Once logged in, the user will be directed to the homepage, where they can then click on any existing posts to view the post and any comments made by other users. They can also add their own comments if desired. When logged in, the user cam also access to the "Dashboard" page by clicking the "Dashboard" link in the navigation area. This page will display existing posts made by them, as well as a form where they can create a new post. On this page, the user can also edit previous posts, as well as delete posts.
